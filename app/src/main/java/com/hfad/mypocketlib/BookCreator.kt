The stories were well received, and boosted the subscriptions figures of The Strand Magazine, prompting Doyle to be able to demand more money for his next set of stories. The first story, A Scandal in Bohemia, includes the character of Irene Adler, who, despite being featured only within this one story by Doyle, is a prominent character in modern Sherlock Holmes adaptations, generally as a love interest for Holmes. Doyle included four of the twelve stories from this collection in his twelve favourite Sherlock Holmes stories, picking The Adventure of the Speckled Band as his overall favourite.",

Hugo's friends chased after them, and they found the young woman dead from fatigue. They also discovered Hugo himself clawed to death by what they thought was a large, demonic hound.
